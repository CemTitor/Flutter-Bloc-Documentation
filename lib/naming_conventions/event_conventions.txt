1)Event Conventions

Events should be named in the past tense because events are things that have already occurred from the bloc's perspective

Anatomy of an Event

Base Event Class: BlocSubject + Event
Initial Loading: BlocSubject + Started
General: BlocSubject + Noun (optional) + Verb (event)

✅ Good

abstract class CounterEvent {}
class CounterStarted extends CounterEvent {}
class CounterIncrementPressed extends CounterEvent {}
class CounterDecrementPressed extends CounterEvent {}
class CounterIncrementRetried extends CounterEvent {}


❌ Bad

abstract class CounterEvent {}
class Initial extends CounterEvent {}
class CounterInitialized extends CounterEvent {}
class Increment extends CounterEvent {}
class DoIncrement extends CounterEvent {}
class IncrementCounter extends CounterEvent {}
